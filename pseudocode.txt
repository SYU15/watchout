Reimplement this game, referring to the source code as needed. You should have commits that refer to each of these numbered steps.

Draw the enemies in an svg window(game window).
//create an object that contains all game elements, set svg elements to have own properties
  - create object that contains all svg elements, storage for properties

//game window will have enemies (svgs), have properties in object

Make it so that the enemies move to a new random location every second using transitions.

//use d3 built in timer to great game loop (while loop that player can escape?)
//update enemy x-y (generate random), redraw enemy with new x-y

Make a differently-colored dot to represent the player. Make it draggable.
//game window will also have player (svg)
//mouseover event

Detect when a enemy touches you.
//when enemy x-y updated, if check player x-y intersects with enemy (pythagorean)

Keep track of the user's score, and display it.
//how much time has passed, increment player score (each loop updates player)

Use css3 animations to make the enemies whirling shuriken.


// get player current cx
// get player current cy
// get player radius

// for each enemy
  // get enemy cx
  // get enemy cy
  // get enemy radius

// If sqrt(playercx - enemycx squared + playercy - enemycy squared) is < playerR*2
  // if curScore > highscore
    // updated high score
  // set score === 0
  // collisions+=1
